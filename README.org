* StompTurner
StompTurner is Page Turner for my tablet. I use [[https://www.zubersoft.com/mobilesheets/][MobileSheetsPro]]
for playing guitar, but turning a page while playing guitar is
challenging. There are pedals available for this job but I found them
a little bit to expensive and so I build my own one.
